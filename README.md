[中文版说明](README.zh.md)

**TL;DR.** `presentation-skills` is a collection of production-grade skills for making the artifacts people actually hand over: editable PowerPoint decks, formal Word documents, and publishable demo videos. The flagship skill is `ppt-polished-deck-collab`, which builds editable, validated PowerPoint decks across research reports, executive narratives, technical explainers, keynote-style talks, and template-driven business decks.

| Skill | Best For | Demo Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ppt-polished-deck-collab` | Editable research reports, executive decks, strategy narratives, technical explainers, keynote-style talks, template-driven business decks | Two Apple financial-analysis decks with the same source theme but very different presentation languages: formal research-report style and editorial-ink native PPTX style |
| `word-polished-doc-collab` | Formal reports, board attachments, research appendices, policy docs, consulting-style Word deliverables | Lightweight Chinese report plus refined English consulting report with preview and QA bundle |
| `web-demo-video-synthesis` | Product walkthroughs, narrated web demos, short-form explainers, publishable demo videos | End-to-end webpage, voiceover, subtitles, screen recording, and final MP4 pipeline |
| `xhs-markdown-card-collab` | Publishable Xiaohongshu image-card posts from Markdown, research/job posts, structured note-style social content | Demo bundles with PNG cards, preview HTML, metadata JSON, and theme variation under a locked typography contract |

`presentation-skills` is an open-source repository of high-quality, commercial-grade presentation tools for agent and assistant environments. The goal is reusable workflows that consistently produce polished, editable, validated deliverables close to real business delivery standards.

These skills were not produced in one pass. They were iterated through many real runs, repeated failure analysis, output review, and workflow rewrites. A large amount of paid model tokens was spent to make the workflows, validation gates, and deliverables actually hold up in practice.

## PowerPoint Decks

`ppt-polished-deck-collab` is designed to cover many deck shapes, not one fixed template:

| Scenario | What it can produce | Demo / Gallery / Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Prompt Example

![Prompt example for the Apple financial report review deck](assets/ppt-prompt-example.jpg)

This prompt style is intentionally specific about workspace placement, source data, reference style, disclosure language, and the `ppt-polished-deck-collab` skill route. The Apple demo turns that kind of request into a reproducible research-report workspace rather than a one-off presentation file.

## What This Repo Provides

### `ppt-polished-deck-collab`

`ppt-polished-deck-collab` produces editable, high-quality, highly automated PowerPoint decks for both business and academic use. It can build a new deck from scratch, work from a user-provided template, inherit a user’s existing slide master and layouts, and modify an existing `pptx` while preserving editability.

It is designed for strategy decks, technical explainers, research talks, thesis defenses, product presentations, operations reviews, management decks, and other presentation-heavy workflows where the final artifact must still behave like a real PowerPoint file.

### `word-polished-doc-collab`

`word-polished-doc-collab` turns Markdown, DOCX, and Python-generated document assets into formal Word deliverables that can survive real review. It focuses on explicit Chinese-English font pairing, heading scale, line spacing, paragraph spacing, table and figure title placement, and delivery evidence instead of one-off DOCX export.

It is designed for contracts, policies, explanatory notes, research appendices, operating reports, board or investment committee attachments, and other Word-first workflows where the content source must remain maintainable after delivery.

### `web-demo-video-synthesis`

`web-demo-video-synthesis` produces narrated, subtitled, publishable videos in a highly automated way. It can turn articles, posts, product walkthroughs, web demos, and technical explanations into videos suitable for platforms such as TikTok, Xiaohongshu, and Bilibili.

It is designed for technical introductions, business demos, product explainers, marketing-style walkthroughs, and other short-form or medium-form presentation videos where reproducibility and iteration speed matter.

### `xhs-markdown-card-collab`

`xhs-markdown-card-collab` turns Markdown or lightly structured text into publishable Xiaohongshu image-card posts. It focuses on explicit cover metadata, stable Chinese typography, browser-based pagination, visual QA, and style variation without re-breaking proven type-size ranges.

It is designed for job posts, lab recruiting posts, research-note threads, structured commentary cards, product explainers, and other social content where the output must still read cleanly on a phone rather than merely “fit into a PNG”.

## Skill Details

### `ppt-polished-deck-collab`

`ppt-polished-deck-collab` starts by turning the user's story into a slide order, one clear message per page, and the evidence each page needs. It then generates a real editable `.pptx`, so the result can still be revised in PowerPoint instead of becoming a stack of screenshots.

Common tools:
- `python-pptx` for editable PowerPoint text, shapes, tables, and pages
- Native PowerPoint charts, `matplotlib` / `seaborn` / `pandas` figures, or image assets depending on the content
- PowerPoint or LibreOffice for slide-by-slide preview export
- Connector and layout checks when the deck includes flowcharts, architecture diagrams, or other editable structures

Typical workflow:
- Confirm the audience, use case, slide count, template, and style boundary
- Organize the slide outline, key message for each page, and required chart or visual assets
- Generate the editable PowerPoint, using a template or modifying an existing deck when needed
- Export slide previews and check text overflow, blurry charts, misplaced elements, and inconsistent page style
- Deliver the PowerPoint, PDF or previews, plus the review notes needed for handoff

Featured deck examples:
- Editorial native PPTX style demo: `demos/apple-editorial-ink-native/`
- Current research-report demo: `demos/apple-financial-report-review/`
- Archived strategy-deck demo: `old/demos/standard-wars-executive-deck/`

Key outputs:
- `demos/apple-editorial-ink-native/final/apple_editorial_ink_native_test.pptx`
- `demos/apple-editorial-ink-native/build/rendered/contact_sheet.png`
- `demos/apple-financial-report-review/final/apple_fy2025_financial_report_review.pptx`

### `word-polished-doc-collab`

`word-polished-doc-collab` starts by turning Markdown or an older Word draft into a stable structure of headings, body text, tables, images, and captions. It then generates a formal `.docx` with consistent fonts, line spacing, paragraph spacing, and caption placement, so the result can survive review and later editing.

Common tools:
- `python-docx` for generating and editing Word documents
- Direct OOXML handling when exact Chinese, Latin, and complex-script font slots matter
- Word or LibreOffice for PDF and page-preview export
- `matplotlib` / `pandas` when the document needs generated charts or tables

Typical workflow:
- Confirm the document purpose, source draft, and target formatting
- Clean up the structure of headings, body text, lists, tables, images, and captions
- Generate the `.docx`, using Chinese formal-report or English consulting-report typography when appropriate
- Export previews and check fonts, heading hierarchy, line spacing, tables, figures, headers, footers, and overall page layout
- Keep previews and review notes for formal reports so the document remains easy to revise and verify

Featured demos:
- `demos/word-lightweight-industrial-operations-brief/`
- `demos/word-refined-industrial-service-transformation/`

Key outputs:
- `demos/word-lightweight-industrial-operations-brief/out/industrial_operations_brief.docx`
- `demos/word-lightweight-industrial-operations-brief/out/preview/industrial_operations_brief.pdf`
- `demos/word-refined-industrial-service-transformation/build/docx/industrial_service_transformation.docx`
- `demos/word-refined-industrial-service-transformation/temp/qa/qa_report.md`

### `web-demo-video-synthesis`

`web-demo-video-synthesis` starts by splitting the narration into short segments, generating segment audio, and then using a timing table to drive web recording, subtitles, and final video composition. It keeps the audio, captions, recording, and final MP4 as separate outputs, so copy changes, subtitle changes, or re-recording can be done without rebuilding everything from scratch.

Common tools:
- TTS APIs or macOS `say` for segment audio
- Playwright for browser-controlled screen recording
- `ffmpeg` for combining video, audio, and subtitles
- Subtitle files and resolution settings for horizontal videos, vertical videos, and platform safe areas

Typical workflow:
- Prepare the narration and web demo
- Generate segment audio and confirm segment durations
- Record the web page according to the timing table
- Generate subtitles
- Mix audio, video, and subtitles into an MP4
- Check audio-video sync, subtitle position, image clarity, and whether key content is cropped

Featured demo:
- `demos/web-demo-video-synthesis-financial-agent/`

Public demo video:
- Bilibili: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1j6NwzaEDZ/

### `xhs-markdown-card-collab`

`xhs-markdown-card-collab` starts by cleaning up Markdown into phone-readable headings, lists, and emphasized points, then renders the result as vertical image cards in a real browser. It is designed for research notes, recruiting posts, product explainers, and structured commentary that should read like publishable Xiaohongshu cards instead of ordinary web screenshots.

Common tools:
- Markdown and YAML front matter for body content, cover title, organization, tags, and highlights
- HTML / CSS for real browser layout
- Playwright or similar browser automation for PNG export
- Theme colors, page frame, decorations, and content grouping for style variation

Typical workflow:
- Clean up the text structure while preserving the original meaning
- Define cover information and a mobile-first page size
- Render page-by-page PNG output and an HTML preview
- Check cover density, pagination, empty space, long text wrapping, orphan headings, and mobile readability
